AIGP held an August challenge for all of it's members

The challenge was to finish the most number of games in August

11 members entered their names with over 500 games played between them

Finally Harshit Tiwari (OGS: HarshIT) won the prize, a nice Go keychain from Nihon Kiin

The challenge for September+October is to have the most number of your games reviewed because many of us know, reviews are the best way to get a pinpoint on your weak points!
